**Tool-Upgrade Delivery Service** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which makes retrieving upgraded farm tools 
less tedious. With this mod, Clint (the blacksmith) will simply send you an e-mail with the upgraded tool included as soon as 
the upgrade is finished. No more visiting the blacksmith simply to get your improved farm tool!
