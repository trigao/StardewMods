# Release notes
## 1.2.0
* Added a [Lost Books] tab to the collections page displaying the currently found books. Each found book shows a content preview on mouse hover and can be read directly.
* Added a Congratulations-message when the player has found all lost books.
* Added mod configuration options (config.json):
  * You can now set the duration how long a museum item description will be shown.
  * You can now enable the visual "can-place" space indicator in the museum for spaces which already have an item placed on. 
* In the museum, there are a couple of museum spaces which cannot be reached by foot. These spaces are now marked with a different color. See [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Museum) ("Notes" section) for details.
* Added Portugese translation (thanks to user "Caua775" from nexusmods).

## 1.1.1
* Fixed issue where loading multiple saves on the same game instance (not closed and restarted) would give the player multiple objects of the same item when only a single object was taken from a chest and placed in the inventory.
* In some cases the in-game "museum-item placement" bug wasn't fixed. This has been addressed.
* Added Spanish translation (thanks to user "igoutta" from nexusmods).

## 1.1
* Lost Books can now be "grabbed & sent" to the library even when the player's inventory has no free space.
* Added Chinese translation (thanks to user "FarAways" from nexusmods).
* Added German translation.

## 1.0 (Initial Release)
